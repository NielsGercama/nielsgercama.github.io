const BIO = "<strong>Niels Gercama</strong> is a new media artist and author between Amsterdam and Berlin. His work investigates fluidity and mutability as insurgent strategies for narrative building and artistic practice. He combines simulation methods, plastic materials and textual media to create a nuanced emotional and creative sensitivity. In his work, people and overheard conversations are translated into landscapes of skin, plastic and gelatinous materials. Themes of labor, sexuality and algorithmic control are investigated, mixed and destroy-destroyed. <br><br> Niels was born June 1997 in the swamps near Amsterdam, and spent his formative years travelling the space between a trailer park and flatland country side. His formal education is in artificial intelligence and new media design. This combination of disciplines allows him to criticize the hyper-modern data driven tools of control in a visual and artistic manner. His work has been shown across Europe and he has lectured at the University of Arts Berlin."
